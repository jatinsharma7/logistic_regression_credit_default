# Logistic Regression - Credit Card Default

The goal is to predict the probability of credit default based on credit card ownerâ€™s characteristics and payment history.
This notebook uses the UCI CreditCardFraud data - the task is to see which variables are the strongest predictors of default, and to make predictions on which customers are likely to default.
